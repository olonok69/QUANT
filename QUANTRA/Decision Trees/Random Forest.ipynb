    "The key parameters to adjust when using the random forest method is n_estimators and max_features. The larger value of n_estimators, the better it is but it will take longer to compute and the results will stop getting significantly better beyond a critical number of trees. The max_features control the size of the features. Smaller size helps to achieve a greater reduction in variance (overfit) but also greater increase in bias (underfit). In the last section, we will learn on to find the best values of these parameters. <BR>"
